State management and debounce implementation for business website
React State Management Implementation
	•	Use debouncing technique for form field updates
	◦	Implement in handler function, not useEffect
	◦	Update store first, then update local component state
	◦	Pattern: onChange → debounced store update → state update
	•	Centralized state approach required
	◦	All form questions must be added to store with default values on page load
	◦	Each page loads 5 questions → add all to currentForm with defaults
	◦	Store maintains all form data across components
Form Validation Architecture
	•	Validation runs when user clicks “Next” button
	◦	checkValidity method extracts data from form state
	◦	Generates config for each question (ID, value, ruleset)
	◦	Passes config to main validation service
	•	Centralized validation benefits
	◦	Consolidated error handling across components
	◦	Easier maintenance of validation rules
	◦	Better tracking and management
	•	Config structure includes
	◦	Question ID and form state values
	◦	Ruleset (max length, conditions, etc.)
	◦	Screen-specific validation configurations
Implementation Requirements
	•	Create similar validation function in Tax/residency folder
	◦	Follow business details validation pattern
	◦	Separate file for validation logic
	◦	Maintain centralized config approach
	•	Remove main hook dependencies
	◦	Priority task over other work
	◦	PKYC work is secondary priority
Action Items
	•	Complete state management refactor by EOD today
	◦	Implement debouncing pattern in handlers
	◦	Set up centralized validation system
	◦	Create Tax/residency validation function
	•	EOD deadline is firm and dynamic based on completion needs

Form validation implementation for tax residency
Form Validation Implementation Overview
	•	Moving from master hook approach to decentralized component-level state management
	•	Three-part implementation process for tax residency form validation
	•	Centralizing validations across application for common field types
	•	Divyansh created form validation service with designated design pattern
Technical Architecture Changes
	•	Removing existing master hook that manages all states
	•	Individual components will manage their own field states
	•	Form slice in Redux will maintain current form data
	◦	Contains all questions and answers for active form
	◦	Questions added dynamically when they appear on screen
	◦	No preemptive/proactive question addition
	•	Business validations stored separately from form state
	◦	Validation rules mapped when validation called
	◦	Tightly typed parameters required
Current Implementation Status
	•	Tax residency master hook removal in progress
	•	State management transition to individual components underway
	•	Validation service structure needs proper typing
	◦	Field objects require specific type definitions
	◦	Three common values across all fields
	◦	Condition parameter should be optional
Next Steps
	•	Call Divyansh after this meeting for detailed implementation guidance
	•	Update validation service with proper TypeScript typing
	•	Create type definitions for field objects and validation rules
	•	Implement form slice structure for current form state management
